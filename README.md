There is a png file of a neural network architecture in the repo. A graph was used to originally describe the neural network architecture. There are two input neurons and two output neurons with hidden layer neurons as well in the base architecture. Various .py files exist to build from written with the aid of GPT-5.2. I wished to portray what ChatGPT 5.2 wrote my neural network into using its prompts. There was some direction give by me, but the code was pure AI written code to show its basic functioning with the Young Neural Network schematic without much help or checking from a human. Cheers!
