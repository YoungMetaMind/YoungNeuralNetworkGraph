There is a png file of a neural network architecture in the repo. A graph was used to originally describe the neural network architecture. There are two input neurons and two output neurons with hidden layer neurons as well in the base architecture. And from the base architecture more complex and different neural network architectures can be designed. Imagine all the neurons as nodes and then connect the nodes in different and more complex ways. Cheers!
