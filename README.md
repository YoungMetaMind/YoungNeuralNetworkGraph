There is a png file of a neural network architecture graph in the repo. A graph can describe a neural network architecture. There are two input neurons and two output neurons with hidden layer neurons as well in the base model or graph. And from the base model or graph more complex and different neural network architectures can be designed. Imagine all the neurons as nodes and then connect the nodes in different and more complex ways while trying to keep the triangles embedded so to fork into different neural architectures. Cheers!
